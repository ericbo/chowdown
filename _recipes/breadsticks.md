image: breadsticks.jpg
tags: bread sticks, bread, pizza

ingredients:
- Pizza Stone
- Pizza dough
- Gratted Garlic (Gralic powder also works)
- Olive Oil
- (optional) Black Pepper
- (optional) Parmesian

directions:
- Prepare your pizza dough, devide into balls, place in a glass oiled container with a cover. Let it sit in the refrigerator for 7-10 days for best results.
- Preheat oven and pizza stone at 500F for 30.
- I like to prepare a cup of olive oil with grated garlic, fresh black pepper, and parmisan. I will use this later with a brush to season my dough.
- Toss the pizza dough (the part of the dough facing the bottom of the container should be facing up in the oven) onto the pizza stone. Quickly brush on your oil.
- Let cook for roughly 8 minutes or until golden brown. Place on a wire rack to cool and top off with some extra parmisan (or salt).
- Cut up and serve.

For best result you really need to age your dough for at least 7 days. This will give it that extra crunch on the surface 
and that tanginus from the yeast slowly working at the dough. This is a greate recipe if you prepared pizza dough
and never got around to using it all.
