tags: bread

ingredients:
- 2 cups of finely ground cornmeal
- 1 tsp of kosher salt 
- 1/2 tsp of baking powder
- 1/2 tsp of baking soda
- 2 large eggs
- 1 1/2 cups of buttermilk (add 1-2 tbsp of an acid to regular/vegan milk achive similar results, I use vinegar)
- 1/2 cup of lard

directions:
- Start out by pouring 2 cups of finely ground cornmeal into a mixing bowl. Then, add 1 teaspoon of kosher salt, 1/2 a teaspoon of baking powder, and 1/2 a teaspoon of baking soda. Whisk together accordingly. 
- In a separate mixing bowl, whisk 2 large eggs and 1 1/2 cups of buttermilk together. Pour your cornmeal mixture into the bowl and whisk everything together until you end up with a thin and cake-like batter. 
- In a cast iron skillet, melt 1/2 a cup of lard over medium flame. When it is melted, without being too hot, add about half of it to your cornbread batter and whisk to combine. 
- Place the skillet with the remaining lard over medium-high heat until shimmering and very hot for a super crisp crust on the bottom of your cornbread. Carefully dump the batter into the skillet, where it should begin to sizzle. Smooth out the top of the batter and place the skillet into a preheated 425F oven for about 20 to 25 minutes until set, light brown in the center, and deep golden brown around the edges. 
- Ensure that the cornbread is cooked by using a toothpick and making sure that there are only a few moist crumbs remaining on the toothpick. Carefully remove the cornbread from the skillet and allow it to cool on a wire rack for about 10 to 15 minutes before slicing and serving while it is still warm.
