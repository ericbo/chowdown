tags: pancakes, potato, latkes

ingredients:
- 4 large russet potatoes
- 1 small onion
- 3-4 eggs
- 1 cup Panko breadcrumbs 
- Vegetable oil

directions:
- Start by peeling 4 large russet potatoes and then grating them using a box grater. Also grate a small onion along with the potatoes.
- Dump the grated potatoes and onion onto a fresh/clean kitchen towel, twist into a tight bundle and wring all the excess water out of the potatoes into a separate bowl. You should end up with about a 1/2 cup of water from 4 potatoes. 
- Once all the water has been wrung out of the potatoes, put the bowl with the potato water aside. Don’t throw away any of the potato water!
- After the potato water has sat in the bowl for about 5 minutes, all the starch will set at the bottom. Empty the water into a separate bowl, leaving just the starch in the bowl. 
- At this point, start by adding 3 eggs to the bowl and beat together until eggs and starch are completely mixed.
- Into an extra large bowl, add the grated potatoes and onion. Pour in the egg and starch mixture along with a cup of panko breadcrumbs. Mix together by hand until the mixture holds its shape when pressed together. If not, add another egg. 
- Once mixed and pressed, form the potatoes into balls and smoosh them down to get crispy edges when frying them.  
- Into a 12-inch skillet, add about ½ inch of vegetable oil and heat to 375°F.  Add the latkes and fry each side for 4-5 minutes, or until deeply golden brown and crispy. 
- Once fully cooked, place the latkes on a wire rack to drain and season with kosher salt immediately after coming out of the oil. 
- Top the latkes however you like! I went with smoked salmon with cream cheese and a sprig of dill for one, pastrami with whole grain mustard and a cornichon pickle for another, cream cheese and spicy red pepper jelly, and lastly yogurt with pomegranate seeds, sliced habanero and a drizzle of clover honey.

The only thing better than carbs is deep fried carbs. I personaly prepare these for brunch as a fancy alternative to store bought hash browns.
